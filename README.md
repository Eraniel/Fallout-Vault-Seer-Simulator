# Fallout-Vault-Seer-Simulator

This is one of my first projects on React that I have made by myself. The game idea was taken from "Reigns" game and universe from "Fallout" games. I decided to make it because I like playing games.

In this demo-version of the game you are playing as a Vault-seer, and you should try to stay alive as long as possible. I am sure that game will be better with shuffle, but I have made not so much game-events, that's why they are just random instead.
